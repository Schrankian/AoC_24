# Advent of Code 2024
This Repo contains my code for the 2024 version of [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/). <br>
For the programming language I used `Rust`, because I wanted to test out how Rust-Workspaces (aka Monorepos in Rust) works.

### Run Code
Use either `cargo build` to build all workspaces, or `cargo build -p day1` to build a specific workspace.<br>
Alternatively, just use `cargo run -p day1` to run a single workspace directly (implizit build)
